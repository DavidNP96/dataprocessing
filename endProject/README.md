In the world humans eat too much meat for it te be sustainable and morally sound. thats why I want to show facts of the current meat industry that can shed light on the industry as a whole. I want to show how many animals are being slaightered each day or even each second. and provide side information to help trigger consioussness about the size and impact of this industry.

Describe your solution in full detail.
In order for people to really grasp the size and impact of this industry. I first want to explaint to the audience why they should think about this
industry. so maybe shock them with a video of the farming process or with a visualization of how much co2 the farming industry produces. then give them options to look at other stats like amount of animals that ge slaughtered and health stats.

Summarize your idea in a single sentence, connecting it to the “gap” that you describe.

In short I want to create consioussness about the impact of the meat industry.

Include a visual sketch of what the final product will look like for the user; if you envision the application to have multiple screens, sketch these all out separately. Clearly specify the possible user interactions, and include concrete examples of data. Your sketches do not have to be professional-looking, but they have to be complete and neat!

 Example sketch for a mobile app

 Example sketch for a data visualization

Include a list of main features that will be available to users. All features should also be visible in the sketch. Keep it brief.

Split the features into 1) the minimum viable product (MVP) and 2) parts that are optional to implement.

A minimum viable product is the product with as least features as possible, which still helps solve the problem for your target audience. We think it’s important to clearly define this, because it defines the minimum amount of work that you will have to put into the project.

Other parts of your project may be optional to implement or “nice to have”.

I think that I can get a large amount of information of these websites.
for live updates worldwide:

for static yearly data in NL, and wordlwide:
http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/publication/?PA=7123slac
http://www.upc-online.org

the hardest part willprobably streaming live input into my visualization, because im am totally unfamiliar with this. though I think there will be a lot of documentation on this and knowledge for me to dig into.
